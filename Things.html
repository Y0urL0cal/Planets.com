            <h1>Mercury</h1>
        <p>This makes Mercury the smallest and least massive planet in the solar system. However, thanks to its high density  a robust 5.427 g/cm3, which is just slightly lower than Earth's 5.514 g/cm3 â€“ Mercury has a surface gravity of 3.7 m/s2, which is the equivalent of 0.38 g. </p>

        <h1>Venus</h1>
    <p>Since Venus and Earth are almost the same size and have about the same mass, the surface gravity on Venus is almost the same as the surface gravity on Earth. The surface gravity on Venus is about 91% of the surface gravity on Earth, so if you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh 91 pounds on Venus. </p>

        <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>Near the surface of Earth, gravity has a strength of about 9.8 N/kg, but this number varies slightly from place to place: it's slightly less on tall mountains, for instance, but we'll take 9.8 N/kg as good enough. </p>

    <h1>Mars</h1>
    <p>Mars has about one-third the gravity of Earth. A rock dropped on Mars would fall slower than a rock dropped on Earth. Things weigh less on Mars than they weigh on Earth. A person who weighs 100 pounds on Earth would only weigh about 38 pounds on Mars because of less gravity</p>

            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
        <p>Although Jupiter is a great deal larger in size, its surface gravity is just 2.4 times that of the surface gravity of Earth. This is because Jupiter is mostly made up of gases. If you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh 240 pounds on Jupiter  </p>

    <div id="Saturn">

            <h1>Saturn</h1>
        <p> However, Saturn's gravity is only 1.08 times the gravity on Earth because Saturn is such a large planet. An object weighing 100 lbs on Earth would weigh 108 lbs on Saturn. Saturn is less dense than water. If there were a body of water large enough to hold Saturn, it would float!</p>

                <h1>Uranus</h1>
            <p>This is because Uranus is made up of gases and is not solid like Earth. This makes Uranus very light for its size. The surface gravity on Uranus is about 86% of the surface gravity on Earth, so if you weigh 100 pounds on Earth, you would weigh 86 pounds on Uranus  </p>

                    <h1>Neptune</h1>
                <p> All told, it is 3.86 times the size of Earth and 17 times as massive. But, being a gas giant, it has a low density of 1.638 g/cm3. All of this works out to a surface gravity of 11.15 m/s2 (or 1.14 g), which again is measured at Neptune's cloud tops.</p>

            <h1>Black holes</h1>
            <span>
                <p> This... mysterious hole which is invisble and can be found anywhere in the galaxy and get close to it- Boom- Know one knows what happends...  This is called a balck hole  . 
                <hr>
                What is a black hole ?
                <br>
                <br>
                A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light and other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape it.
                <hr>
                What's inside a black hole?
                <br>
                <br>
                Don't let the name fool you: a black hole is anything but empty space. Rather, it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of New York City.
